A young Musk, inspired by the dot-com boom, sought an industry with inefficiencies to exploit. He stumbled upon an arbitrage opportunity in the third-world debt portfolio of the Bank of Nova Scotia. Musk calculated the backstop value of Brazilian debt at 25 cents per dollar while it was trading at 20 cents, indicating a significant profit opportunity. However, his proposal to invest in the debt was rejected by the bank's CEO due to concerns about past debt defaults and the potential for U.S. Treasury default.
