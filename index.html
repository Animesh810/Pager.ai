        const summary5Min = `In a gripping tale set at Manor Farm, the cruel farmer Mr. Jones meets an unexpected end as his own animals rise against him. The uprising unfolds when Jones and his four men attempt to punish the beasts for allegedly stealing food, but instead, the tables turn, with the animals retaliating violently, forcing their oppressors off the farm.

With Jones and his men vanquished, the victorious animals revel in their newfound freedom by systematically destroying any remnants of their former tormentor, including his tools and instruments of cruelty like whips and harnesses. To break free from their past, they even burn personal items once cherished, such as Snowball's ribbons and Boxer's cap.

The leader of the rebellion, Napoleon, marks the occasion by serving the animals a generous helping of corn and biscuits – a luxurious treat they have rarely experienced. As they feast, the animals finally sleep soundly for the first time in what feels like an eternity.

Awakening the following morning, the liberated creatures discover they now own Manor Farm and eagerly explore their new domain, filled with curiosity and excitement. The story poignantly underscores the injustice of human oppression and extols the virtues of freedom and self-determination as the animals celebrate their newly claimed territory. In George Orwell's Animal Farm, a revolutionary uprising erupts, led by Snowball and Boxer against their human master, Mr. Jones. The battle, known as the Battle of the Cowshed, unfolds in a frenzy of animal versus man in the farmyard. As the humans are driven back, a tragic accident occurs: Boxer, clad in iron shoes, tramples a stable-lad, inadvertently causing his death. The other animals are stunned but Snowball calls for unity, quashing any sentimentality as they are now at war. Meanwhile, Mollie, one of the more submissive animals, hides and survives the chaos unscathed.

With their victory secured, the animals celebrate with songs, a solemn funeral for the fallen sheep, speeches emphasizing the importance of sacrifice, and the creation of an "Animal Hero" military decoration, bestowed upon Snowball and Boxer. The recovered gun and cartridges from Mr. Jones belongings are placed at the foot of the flagstaff, to be fired annually on anniversaries of this historic event.

Thus, the animals triumphantly overthrow their human oppressor, paying a heavy price with one casualty along the way. The new order is established under the leadership of Snowball and Boxer, setting the stage for the events that follow in Animal Farm. In George Orwell's Animal Farm, a farm dominated by pigs named Napoleon and Snowball, the animals live under their rule following the ousting of their human owner Mr. Jones. Suspicion arises when the peaceful inhabitants accuse Snowball, initially hailed as a revolutionary leader, of being an invisible threat, causing mischief on the farm at night.

With Napoleon leading the investigation, traces of Snowball's presence are discovered everywhere, fueling the animals' fears. A startling revelation ensues: Snowball, it seems, has betrayed them all by selling himself to Frederick, their mortal enemy at Pinchfield Farm, and had been working covertly for Mr. Jones.

This accusation is met with skepticism as the animals recall Snowball's bravery in the Battle of the Cowshed against their former oppressor. The rising tension on the farm now splits the animal community between those who believe in Napoleon and those who question the validity of his claims, creating a tense atmosphere that echoes the political unrest during Soviet Russia in the story's allegory. In the heart-wrenching aftermath of a grueling battle, the animals of Animal Farm, having tirelessly constructed a windmill over two long years, now faced its unfortunate destruction at the hands of their human adversaries. Yet, victory was declared, for the humans had been driven off their land by none other than their own leaders, Napoleon and his fellow pigs. Despite the poignant loss and the hardships it brought, the animals were swayed by Squealer's eloquent persuasion and Napoleon's triumphant speech to celebrate their victory.

The days that followed saw the farm transformed into a realm of celebration, with food rewards generously distributed among the animals and a splendid new decoration, the Order of the Green Banner, unveiled by none other than Napoleon himself. The atmosphere was one of joy and camaraderie, an exhilarating break from the toils of labor that characterized their daily lives.

However, as the days turned into weeks, a disturbing truth began to surface. It seemed that the pigs had discovered a hidden cache of whisky in the farmhouse and were secretly indulging in its forbidden pleasures. Meanwhile, at night, the ethereal melody of "Beasts of England" could be heard drifting from the farmhouse, hinting at a potential uprising or rebellion among the pigs—a striking contradiction to their supposed ideals and unity.

The tale unfolds with the animals of Animal Farm teetering precariously on the edge of a new chasm, one that threatens to shatter the fragile harmony they had worked so hard to build. Will they manage to maintain their unity in the face of this growing deception, or will the allure of vice and the seductive whispers of rebellion ultimately prove too tempting? Only time will tell. In George Orwell's "Animal Farm," a tragic incident unfolds when Boxer, one of the farm's most loyal and hardworking animals, is inexplicably removed from the farm. Squealer, the deceitful pig, explains that this was due to a misunderstanding about a van labeled "Horse Slaughterer" previously belonging to a knacker. The news leaves the other animals shocked and saddened.

Time passes, and only a handful of the original animals remain – Clover, Benjamin, Moses the raven, and the pigs. The farm, now bustling with more inhabitants, includes those born after the Rebellion or who joined later. These newcomers hold Clover in high regard, listening intently to her tales about the Rebellion that sparked their struggle for freedom.

However, these new horses lack the intelligence and wisdom of the original animals. Meanwhile, Napoleon, the manipulative pig leader, expresses his regret over Boxer's death while reminding the animals of his two favorite maxims – "All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others" and "Four legs good, two legs bad."

Years roll by, and the farm continues to evolve under Napoleon's oppressive rule. The original ideals of equality and freedom that once united the animals now seem distant memories, as they struggle to survive under a regime that bears little resemblance to their original vision. In a compelling scene on Manor Farm, Napoleon, the leader of the pigs, addresses a gathered throng of animals and human visitors. He dismisses whispers of subversion or revolutionary intentions among him and his comrades, assuring they merely yearn for tranquility and seek to maintain normal dealings with their neighboring farms. In an effort to dispel suspicion, Napoleon announces modifications to practices such as the use of "Comrade" in address and the ritualistic Sunday march past a boar's skull, which were previously seen as questionable. The farm's name is subsequently altered from "Animal Farm" to "The Manor Farm."

Following this speech, tensions surface within the pig population as they engage in a heated argument over a card game within the farmhouse, hinting at potential untrustworthiness on the part of Napoleon and Mr. Pilkington. The ensuing altercation leaves the animals outside in a state of bewilderment, unsure of who truly wields the power: pig or man.

        const summary20Min = `In the heart of Mr. Jones's Manor Farm, under the cloak of night, a diverse assembly of creatures - pigs, horses, dogs, goats, even ducklings - gather in the big barn, their owner too intoxicated to remember to close the popholes. The venerable pig, Willingdon Beauty or old Major, calls this gathering to share an extraordinary dream he's had. His days are numbered, and he wants to impart wisdom before his inevitable demise.

With solemnity, old Major describes their lives as a grueling, oppressive existence, laboring endlessly for the comfort and freedom of their human masters. He maintains that it's not the farm's poverty causing this misery but the very humans who own them. He refers to these beings as the real enemy, a label that hangs heavy in the air.

The animals listen intently, their eyes reflecting both intrigue and despair. The cat, however, pays no heed, curled comfortably between two horses throughout Major's passionate speech. Moses, the tame raven, is absent, nestled behind the back door as he sleeps.

As the meeting ends, the animals disperse, each carrying the weight of old Major's words and the harsh realities they now face. The chapter concludes, leaving readers in anticipation for more revelations about old Major's dream and the growing unrest among the farm animals that promises to upend their world as they know it. In a serene farmyard, an elderly pig named Old Major gathers a motley crew of creatures for a secret nighttime gathering. With wisdom in his eyes and a revolutionary spirit coursing through him, he begins to share his captivating vision - a future where the yoke of human oppression is shattered, and animals reign free under the sun. He sings them an old melody, "Beasts of England," that stirs their souls and kindles hope in their hearts. The air crackles with excitement as the animals echo the lyrics with vigor. But alas, their dreamy reverie is abruptly interrupted by the harsh reality as Mr. Jones, the farmer, awakens and scatters them with his terrifying gunshots. Nevertheless, Old Major's words and melodies continue to resonate in their hearts, symbolizing their undying quest for unity and freedom amidst human cruelty. In George Orwell's novel "Animal Farm," the animals rise up against their oppressive owner, Mr. Jones, in a successful revolt. After driving Jones and his men off the Manor Farm, they celebrate by destroying symbols of his rule like whips, harnesses, and other tools of tyranny. The jubilant beasts feast and sing "Beasts of England" before retiring for the night. Waking up to a new dawn, they revel in their freshly claimed freedom and explore the expanded territory of their own farm, marveling at its untapped beauty and abundance. As dawn broke over Animal Farm, the once-enslaved creatures stood triumphant on a hilltop, beaming at their newfound freedom. Their first order of business was to venture into the grand farmhouse, left behind by their former human overlords. Overwhelmed by its opulence, they decided it should serve as a museum, preserving the memory of their struggle.

Breakfast followed, and two intelligent pigs named Snowball and Napoleon took center stage, revealing that they had condensed the principles of Animalism into seven commandments. Inscribed on the barn wall, these were: abstaining from wearing clothes, sleeping in beds, imbibing alcohol, killing fellow animals, viewing humans as enemies, and regarding any creature with four legs or wings as an ally.

With newfound purpose, the animals journeyed to the hayfield under the guidance of Snowball and Napoleon for the hay harvest. However, a cacophony of distress from the cows halted their work—they had not been milked for an entire day. Responding promptly, the pigs resolved the issue, only for the milk to mysteriously vanish when they returned in the evening. The animals were left to ponder this puzzling development as they settled in for another day on their liberated farm. On an extraordinary farm ruled by two wise pigs named Snowball and Napoleon, the animals had formed a unique society based on the radical ideology of Animalism. This society, though, was not a utopia without conflict; these two leaders often clashed over various issues, one such debate centered around establishing a retirement age for the laboring animals.

The pigs also set up numerous Animal Committees, each dedicated to specific groups of animals, and organized educational classes on reading and writing. The farm's inhabitants eagerly embraced these lessons, with many learning to read and write by autumn. However, their efforts to tame wild creatures like rats and rabbits were fruitless.

Snowball, one of the pigs, made a bold move by reducing the Seven Commandments of Animalism into a single maxim: "Four legs good, two legs bad." This simplified principle aimed to shield the animals from any human influence by emphasizing that having two legs was synonymous with human mischief.

Throughout these events, the power struggle between Snowball and Napoleon unfolded, while Animalism was gradually implemented on the farm. The society created by the animals served as a reflection of their wisdom, understanding, and adaptation to the principles they believed would protect them from their age-old enemy – humans. In a farming community teeming with various creatures, there was an ongoing struggle to grasp the Seven Commandments. Amidst this confusion, Snowball, a prominent figure, proposed a simplified philosophy he named Animalism, encapsulated by the maxim: "Four legs good, two legs bad." This principle aimed to shield animals from human dominion, with an exception made for birds – their wings were considered organs of propulsion rather than manipulation, effectively counting as 'legs'.

Meanwhile, Napoleon, another significant figure, prioritized education. He secluded nine newborn puppies from their mothers for private tutoring. The mystery behind the vanishing milk soon unfolded – it was being used in the pigs' food. As murmurs of discontent arose regarding the exclusive access to windfalls like milk and apples, Squealer, a trusted ally, justified this practice by emphasizing its importance for the pigs, who were considered brainworkers essential to the farm's success. Despite unease about Jones, their human owner, potentially returning, the animals reluctantly accepted this arrangement. This tense balance between unity and individualism became the daily rhythm of life in this animal-led society. In George Orwell's Animal Farm, a band of farm animals, inspired by Snowball and Boxer, launch a rebellion against their human master, Mr. Jones. With tactical cunning, they force the humans out of the farmyard through clever ambushes, but during the chaos, Boxer inadvertently kills one of the stable-hands with his iron shoes. Ridden by guilt, Boxer yearns to distance himself from violence, yet Snowball persuades him that it's a necessary part of their struggle for freedom. The victorious animals hold a jubilant celebration and institute decorations as tokens of heroism. Mollie, one of the horses, is later found hiding in fear. In a poignant end to this chapter, the fallen sheep receives a solemn funeral, while "Animal Hero" awards are bestowed upon Snowball, Boxer, and the deceased comrade. The revolution triumphs on the farm, yet at a heavy cost: lives claimed in the pursuit of liberation. Following their triumphant win in the intense Battle of the Cowshed, the animals of Animal Farm rejoiced with exuberance, each recounting tales of valor echoing through the barnyard. A spontaneous ceremony commenced, hoisting their flag high and singing the anthem "Beasts of England" multiple times. A touching funeral was held for a fallen comrade, a sheep, with Snowball delivering a moving eulogy stressing the importance of every animal being prepared to lay down their life for Animal Farm.

In recognition of their heroism, the animals unanimously agreed to establish a military decoration, the "Animal Hero, First Class," which was promptly bestowed upon Snowball and Boxer. This honor came with old horse-brasses to be worn on Sundays and holidays. A posthumous "Animal Hero, Second Class" award was also given to the fallen sheep.

The Battle of the Cowshed became a symbolic name for the ambush site, and Mr. Jones's gun was found at the scene, along with cartridges in the farmhouse. The gun was placed as a memorial at the foot of the flagstaff, to be fired twice a year—once on October 12th, marking the anniversary of the Battle of the Cowshed, and once on Midsummer Day, commemorating the Rebellion day. In George Orwell's 'Animal Farm', a rift emerges among the animal inhabitants of Manor Farm over two contrasting proposals for their future. Snowball, the charismatic intellectual pig and instigator of the uprising against Mr. Jones, envisions a progressive windmill project. This windmill would not only harness power but also automate farm tasks, ushering in an era of greater ease for all animals. Intricate plans for this endeavor are meticulously drawn up within a hidden shed.

However, Napoleon, another pig and Snowball's rival, voices concerns about food production and potential starvation during the construction phase. As a result, he stirs dissent among the animals, creating a deep divide in their ranks. While some follow Snowball's lead for a three-day work week, others align with Napoleon, prioritizing a full manger under his guidance.

The discord is not limited to agricultural matters as both leaders propose contrasting strategies for defending their farm against human attacks. Snowball advocates for the deployment of more pigeons to foment rebellion among neighboring farms, while Napoleon proposes arming themselves with firearms and providing training in their use. The animals, torn between the eloquence of Snowball and the forcefulness of Napoleon, are unable to reach a consensus. Their opinions sway according to who currently holds the floor, leaving the future of Animal Farm uncertain and fraught with tension. In George Orwell's "Animal Farm," a dramatic shift occurs as Napoleon, a cunning pig, seizes power from Snowball following an expulsion. The animals, devoid of consultation, blindly follow their rightfully elected leader due to his authoritative stance. The reasoning behind this sudden change is subtly spun by Napoleon's henchman, Squealer the pig, who claims that the windmill project, initially advocated by Snowball, was actually Napoleon's idea all along.

Napoleon's apparent opposition to the project was strategically employed to oust Snowball, deemed a dangerous character. Through Squealer's persuasive oratory and the intimidating growls of the dogs, the animals are swiftly convinced, accepting this explanation without questioning further. The windmill project, requiring immense labor and potentially reducing rations, proceeds unabated under Napoleon's rule.

This moment marks the beginning of a sinister transformation on the farm as Napoleon's actions are no longer justified through rational discussions but rather manipulation and propaganda, setting the stage for an oppressive regime that would cast long shadows over the once free-spirited Animal Farm. In George Orwell's classic novel "Animal Farm," our protagonists are a group of farm animals who revolt against their human master, Jones, to establish a utopian society under the leadership of Old Major and Snowball. However, after Old Major's death, the charismatic pig Napoleon seizes power.

Napoleon announces a radical shift in policy: engaging in trade with neighboring farms for materials, most significantly a windmill construction project. This decision contradicts previous resolutions that vowed to avoid humans, trading, and money. Nixon cleverly asserts these resolutions were never truly made.

To facilitate interactions with the outside world, a human solicitor named Mr. Whymper from Willingdon is appointed as an intermediary, visiting Animal Farm every Monday. The animals watch these visits with unease but take solace in observing Napoleon bossing Whymper around, reinforcing their superiority.

This newfound relationship between the animals and humans subtly changes over time, as the animals develop a grudging respect for human efficiency. Despite this, humans continue to despise Animal Farm and believe it will fail. The farm is now known by its rightful name instead of being called the Manor Farm, but there are persistent rumors that Napoleon is about to strike a business deal with either Mr. Pilkington from Foxwood or Mr. Frederick from Pinchfield—never both simultaneously.

As the story progresses, Napoleon gradually transforms Animal Farm from a utopian society into something eerily similar to the oppressive regime they had overthrown, subtly illustrating themes of deception, manipulation, and the misuse of power. In Animal Farm, the once-subjugated animals have gained autonomy and learned to manage their own affairs effectively, referring to their home as the Animal Farm instead of the Manor Farm. The humans, including Jones, are no longer part of their daily lives as they've moved away from the area.

In a surprising turn of events, the pigs, led by Napoleon, have taken up residence in the farmhouse, much to the discomfort of some animals. Despite murmurs of dissent, Squealer convinces the others that the pigs need a quiet place for work, given they are the brains of the operation and deserve a more dignified dwelling. This includes sleeping in beds, albeit without sheets, which the animals find hard to reconcile with earlier resolutions against luxuries.

The animals continue their tireless labor, focusing on constructing a windmill that symbolizes hope and unity for them all. However, their hard work is shattered when a violent storm brings down the unfinished mill. In an unexpected twist, Napoleon accuses Snowball, their former ally, of sabotaging the mill and sentences him to death, branding him as a traitor.

The animals are left stunned by this revelation, but Napoleon swiftly regains their support with a rallying call to rebuild the windmill and persevere in their revolutionary goals, come what may. The story continues as the animals grapple with the fallout of these events, their once united front now fractured by suspicion and betrayal. On a transformed farm, once ruled by human farmer Mr. Jones, a new society of animals has emerged post-revolution. Two key figures in this uprising are Snowball and Napoleon. However, suspicion arises when it's discovered that Snowball has been secretly visiting the farm at night, stirring mischief. This revelation sparks accusations from Napoleon and sets off a series of investigations. The animals, already on edge due to an invisible threat they believe Snowball represents, grow increasingly afraid.

The plot thickens when it's exposed that Snowball had been secretly conspiring with Mr. Jones and Frederick of Pinchfield Farm all along. This shocking revelation plunges the animals into disbelief, as they grapple with reconciling this treachery with their memories of Snowball's bravery during the Battle of the Cowshed. The farm, once a symbol of freedom, is now filled with tension and betrayal, leaving the animals to navigate this new reality. In the heart of Animal Farm, Napoleon, its ruthless leader, orchestrates a series of shocking executions, leaving the remaining animals stunned and grief-stricken. Among them, Boxer remains undeterred, channeling his energy into harder work, believing that their downfall lies within themselves rather than their environment.

The remnants of the once-proud community gather around Clover, their eyes reflecting a shared sense of disillusionment and despair. They ponder over their aspirations for a better life, questioning whether the bloodshed and pain were worth the rebellion against human rule.

Clover, overwhelmed by sorrow, breaks into a moving rendition of "Beasts of England," her haunting melody echoing through the farm as she voices their collective thoughts. The story concludes with the animals singing this song mournfully but in perfect harmony, their voices carrying the weight of their longing for the better world they once envisioned—a dream that now seems distant and unattainable. In an unexpected turn of events, the revered anthem, "Beasts of England," was forbidden by Comrade Napoleon. The change came after the melody was sung thrice in a slow and somber tone, unlike any performance before. Delivering this grim news was none other than Squealer, accompanied by two dogs. He declared that the long-awaited Rebellion had reached its climax and the desired society was now established. Both internal and external enemies had been vanquished. Consequently, "Beasts of England" lost its significance. The animals were taken aback, but the bleating of the sheep echoed their mantra, "Four legs good, two legs bad," effectively silencing any potential protests. In its place, Minimus, the poet, composed another song, "Animal Farm, Animal Farm, Never through me shalt thou come to harm!" However, this new melody fell short in comparison to their cherished "Beasts of England." In George Orwell's "Animal Farm," tensions between Napoleon, the ruler of Animal Farm, and Mr. Pilkington, owner of Pinchfield Farm, remained cordial through their intermediary, Whymper. Despite the animals' suspicion towards Pilkington, they preferred him to Frederick, whom they feared and despised. As the windmill neared completion, rumors swirled about an impending attack by Frederick, allegedly aided by bribes to magistrates and police to seize Animal Farm.

Napoleon later clarified that he never intended to sell the timber pile to Frederick; it was merely a ploy to preserve amicable relations with Pilkington. The animals were prohibited from entering Foxwood, and their slogan shifted from "Death to Humanity" to "Death to Frederick."

Soon afterward, another scheme by Snowball, one of the farm's original leaders, came to light. He had surreptitiously mixed weed seeds with the seed corn, leading to a dismal wheat harvest. A gander implicated in the plot confessed and took his own life. It was also disclosed that Snowball never received the "Animal Hero, First Class" decoration as believed; instead, he had been reprimanded for cowardice during the Battle of the Cowshed.

Despite these challenges, the windmill was finally completed in autumn, much to the pride and joy of the animals. Napoleon personally praised their efforts, renaming it "Napoleon Mill." However, two days later, a startling announcement was made at a special meeting in the barn: Napoleon had secretly sold the timber pile to Frederick for removal the following day, leaving the animals stunned and bewildered. In George Orwell's Animal Farm, a band of animal revolutionaries, led by Napoleon, valiantly defend their home from human intruders who destroy their two-year project, the windmill. Despite heavy losses, the animals triumph in the ensuing conflict, but return to find the windmill obliterated.

In the aftermath, Squealer, who missed the battle, returns with news of a victory celebration. However, Boxer, injured and exhausted from the fight, struggles to comprehend how such devastation could be considered a triumph. He points out that they've only reclaimed what was previously theirs, but Squealer claims they have won back every inch of their territory. Despite Boxer's doubts, he reluctantly accepts this explanation and gears up for the daunting task of rebuilding the windmill.

This passage underscores the animals' indomitable spirit, resilience, and determination in the face of adversity, while subtly hinting at their misguided trust in Squealer and Napoleon. It also foreshadows Boxer's impending physical decline and Napoleon's growing influence on the farm. Amidst the rolling green plains, our heroes Boxer the horse and Clover the mare had spent two arduous years laboring over their dream - constructing a windmill on their farm. Yet, fate had other plans as the windmill was cruelly torn apart. However, undeterred, these resilient animals decided to rise once more, with Boxer acknowledging his aging strength might not match its former glory.

Their efforts were rewarded when they managed to reclaim their land from their sworn enemy, led by Comrade Napoleon. A triumphant celebration ensued, echoing with heartfelt speeches, melodious songs, and thoughtful gifts for each participant.

But the revelry was far from over. In a twist of unforeseen circumstances, a forgotten case of whisky was discovered within the farmhouse walls. The night turned into an impromptu carnival of singing and laughter, a joyous release after days of hard work.

The morning dawned with a stark contrast to the previous night's jubilation. A heavy silence fell upon the house, shrouding it in an eerie stillness that hinted at secrets shared and promises made under the influence of the forgotten spirit.

Thus, life on the farm continued, punctuated by its share of hardships and celebrations, as the animals moved forward, unaware of what the future held for them. In the bleak realm of Animal Farm, a somber hush descends as Squealer breaks the devastating news that their revered leader, Comrade Napoleon, has perished. The farmyard is drenched in grief, and straw-strewn vigils become the norm outside Napoleon's abode, as animals grapple with the loss and ponder their destiny without their guiding light.

Rumors swirl through the farm like a wildfire; whispers of betrayal, accusations against Snowball for poisoning the beloved Napoleon. However, by the evening, hope begins to stir as Napoleon starts showing signs of recovery. This unexpected turn of events sets off a flurry of speculation and apprehension among the animals.

As days pass, it becomes increasingly evident that Napoleon is not just alive but strategizing his comeback. The farm undergoes a transformation: brewing and distilling books are ordered, barley fields take precedence over pastures for grazing, and the Fifth Commandment undergoes a subtle yet significant modification – from 'No animal shall drink alcohol' to 'No animal shall drink alcohol to excess.'

One fateful night, a broken ladder is discovered near the Seven Commandments, with Squealer found nearby, seemingly out of place. The venerable Old Benjamin seems to grasp the implications but remains resolutely quiet.

The truth unfolds days later when it's revealed that the Fifth Commandment had been misremembered all along – it was never 'No animal shall drink alcohol,' but rather 'No animal shall drink alcohol to excess.' This revelation adds fuel to the suspicion that Napoleon has been manipulating information and continuing his machinations, even under the veil of illness.

In this tale of power, deception, and survival, the animals of Animal Farm find themselves teetering on the precipice of change, as their cunning leader begins to regain control, leaving them to wonder what lies ahead in this ever-changing world. In George Orwell's allegorical masterpiece, "Animal Farm," an uprising led by a group of intelligent farm animals overthrows their human owner, Mr. Jones, ushering in a utopian era where all creatures are equal. This narrative unfolds on the idyllic Manor Farm, spanning several years as our animal heroes navigate self-governance under the visionary leadership of Snowball and Napoleon, two cunning pigs symbolizing Stalin and Trotsky.

Initially, the farm thrives under their enlightened rule, but gradually, Napoleon's insatiable lust for power takes over. He reshapes the revolution into a dictatorship by employing tactics such as propaganda, false accusations against Snowball, and strategic alliances with other animals.

As time marches on, Napoleon establishes himself as the farm's president, while the revolutionary ideals that once united them begin to dissipate like morning mist. Towards the end of the book, Moses, a prophetic raven, reemerges, whispering tales of a paradise called Sugarcandy Mountain, causing some animals to question their reality and the legitimacy of Napoleon's reign.

In essence, "Animal Farm" is a compelling exploration of power, corruption, and the degradation of ideals when placed in the hands of the tyrannical few. In George Orwell's "Animal Farm," a heart-wrenching turn of events unfolds when the beloved workhorse, Boxer, is abducted by a ruthless horse slaughterer and glue boiler. His fellow animals are left in shock as they helplessly watch the van carrying their comrade disappear into the distance. In a desperate bid to save him, they chase after the van, but it's too late. Three days later, a somber announcement is made: Boxer has died at Willingdon's hospital.

Squealer, the cunning pig who serves as the party's spokesman, claims he was present during Boxer's last moments. According to his account, Boxer's final words were not about rest or peace, but about the windmill and his unwavering support for Animal Farm and Comrade Napoleon. The news of Boxer's demise leaves the animals devastated, their spirits now mirroring the bleakness of the farm that once symbolized hope and unity. The loss echoes through the farm, a stark reminder of the cruel world they are still struggling to navigate under the iron rule of the pigs who betrayed them all. In a heart-wrenching twist, beloved Boxer, the hardworking old cart-horse, passed away three days after being taken to Willingdon Hospital. Squealer, the cunning pig, announced this sad news at a gathering, claiming he was by Boxer's side during his final moments. In those last breaths, Boxer expressed his sorrow for not living to see the completion of their windmill project and pledged undying loyalty to Napoleon and Animal Farm.

Yet, whispers circulated that Boxer had been sent to be slaughtered due to a misleading van label. Squealer swiftly dismissed these rumors as unfounded, attributing them to old markings from a previous knacker's van. The animals, finding solace in the notion of Boxer's peaceful demise and Napoleon's care during that time, began to grieve less fervently.

In a solemn tribute, Napoleon addressed the gathering, promising a wreath and a memorial banquet in honor of Boxer. True to his word, on the day of the event, a large wooden crate arrived from Willingdon, overflowing with whisky. The farm erupted into boisterous singing, squabbles, and eventually a noisy crash, leaving the following morning unusually quiet as the pigs reveled in their new acquisition in private. In the tenth chapter, time has eroded the vivid memories of the pre-Rebellion era, leaving only a few, including Clover, Benjamin, Moses the raven, and some pigs, as the last living testaments to those days. Once lively personalities like Muriel, Bluebell, Jessie, Pincher, Snowball, and Boxer have all passed away, leaving behind an air of nostalgia. The farm's current ruler is Napoleon, a 24-stone boar who still maintains his power with Squealer, now plump, by his side.

The once tumultuous atmosphere has given way to the arrival of newcomers - horses. These intelligent creatures are either newly acquainted or have heard the faded tales of the Rebellion. Despite their labor prowess and companionship, they exhibit a shocking lack of knowledge, struggling even beyond the letter B in the alphabet.

Among them, Clover, a retired mare, is highly revered due to her captivating stories of the past. The oldest inhabitant, Benjamin, remains largely unaltered by time save for a few grey hairs and an increased melancholy since Boxer's passing. The farm continues its daily routine under their watchful eyes, waiting for the day when the memories they hold might once again ignite the spirit of revolution. In George Orwell's "Animal Farm," an unexpected revolution unfolds as the once lowly pigs start walking upright, asserting dominance, and seizing control from other farm animals. This dramatic shift leaves the animals reeling with shock, fear, and confusion. The sheep, known for their gullibility, swiftly adjust to this new reality, echoing the slogan "Four legs good, two legs better."

Under the leadership of Napoleon, these pigs transform into rulers, mimicking humans by wielding whips and donning human clothing. They also introduce modern conveniences like a wireless set and a telephone to the farm. As the animals grow accustomed to their new masters, fear silences any potential questions or protests, highlighting the brutal reality of power subjugation and exploitation. In George Orwell's "Animal Farm," we find ourselves in a chilling turn of events as Manor Farm's human representative, Mr. Pilkington, unexpectedly commends the farm for its stern conditions and unyielding treatment of its animal inhabitants, all led by the cunning Napoleon the pig who has rechristened the farm The Manor Farm. In a seemingly ironic toast to the prosperity of Animal Farm, Napoleon's pigs have gradually transformed into indistinguishable reflections of their once-oppressive human counterparts, a grim reminder of how the revolution's ideals and values have been eroded by corruption.

As if this revelation wasn't shocking enough, a heated argument ensues between Napoleon and Mr. Pilkington over a card game, further underscoring the rampant hypocrisy and deceit that has seeped into the heart of the farm.
